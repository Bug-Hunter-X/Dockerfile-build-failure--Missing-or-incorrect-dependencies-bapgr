This repository contains a Dockerfile with a common error: incorrect specification of dependencies. The original Dockerfile `Dockerfile` fails to build because the `requirements.txt` file is missing or contains errors. The corrected Dockerfile `Dockerfile.fixed` provides a solution.  The issue is resolved by ensuring the `requirements.txt` file exists and contains the correct list of dependencies for the application, and by ensuring that the `COPY` commands are in the correct order.
